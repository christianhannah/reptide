# reptide

## Overview

This software is designed to compute the expected TDE rate for a galaxy based on 2-body relaxation under the assumption of spherical symmetry. The primary inputs to this code are either a 1-D surface brightness profile or a 1-D stellar density profile and the central black hole mass. The code returns the TDE rate and other relevant quantities, such as the distribution function, angular momentum diffusion coefficients, etc.

## Features

- Convert surface brightness data to 3-D stellar density via MGE fitting.
- Works with discrete surface brightness and density profiles.
